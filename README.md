## Project Summary
This project aims to analyze customer behavior data from Amazon to gain insights into shopping patterns, preferences, and areas for improvement. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, valuable insights were obtained to guide actionable recommendations for enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing business strategies.

## Algorithm Used
The project utilized various techniques from the field of data analysis and visualization. These techniques included descriptive statistics, data visualization, and customer segmentation using clustering algorithms.

## Work Done
1. **Data Collection:** The Amazon customer behavior dataset was collected, containing information about customer demographics, shopping habits, and preferences.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The dataset was thoroughly explored using Python and libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. EDA revealed insights about customer demographics, purchase behavior, review importance, and more.
3. **Customer Segmentation:** Customers were segmented based on purchase behavior using K-means clustering. This allowed for the identification of distinct customer groups with similar purchase patterns.
4. **Visualization:** Various visualizations, including pie charts, bar plots, histograms, and rating scale visualizations, were created to showcase key insights such as gender distribution, age demographics, shopping satisfaction, and more.
5. **Recommendations:** Actionable recommendations were derived from the analysis, aimed at improving personalized recommendations, cart conversion rates, customer reviews, and overall user experience.

## Conclusion
The project successfully analyzed Amazon's customer behavior data to uncover significant insights and trends.
